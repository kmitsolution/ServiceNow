To create a `dynatrace_integration` user in **ServiceNow** for integrating with **Dynatrace**, you need to assign specific roles that allow the user to access, read, and write the necessary ITOM and CMDB data. This user acts as the bridge for Dynatrace to interact with ServiceNow's Configuration Management Database (CMDB), incidents, and other ITSM functions.

### ✅ Steps to Create the `dynatrace_integration` User:

1. **Navigate to Users**:

   * Go to **User Administration > Users** in ServiceNow.
   * Click **New** to create a new user.
   * Fill in the basic details:

     * **User ID**: `dynatrace_integration`
     * **Name**: Dynatrace Integration User
     * Assign a strong **password**.

2. **Assign the following roles** to the user:

> 🛑 **Important Notes:**

* Role names can vary slightly depending on the **version of ServiceNow** and the **Dynatrace app version**.
